          'This paper presents the design and implementation of two approaches to solve the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a few-shot benchmark of human-level abstract problem-solving, to serve as a north-star towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The first approach features a neuro-symbolic reasoning system using LLMs, while the second approach uses brute-force technique like Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to tackle ARC. Our first approach proposes a modular pipeline that (1) encodes colored grid tasks into a compact 64-token representation, (2) enriches training data with Re-ARC and Concept-ARC augmentations, (3) fine-tunes decoder-only language models (e.g., LLaMA-3.2B, NeMo-Minitron-8B) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) under tight compute budgets, and (4) applies a depth-first-search sampler with log-softmax scoring to yield and rank candidate solutions across multiple augmented views. Compared to classical and prior neural approaches, achieves a better output through pipeline integration of LLM & continuous Augmentation. Our open-source toolkit not only demonstrates latent abstract reasoning capabilities in large language models but also introduces a reusable DSL for grid transformations and a data-centric augmentation suite. Our second approach, utilizing DSL+GA, provides structured guidance through the search space. We describe the DSL primitives and GA design in detail and analyse the code structure. We then compare state-of-art systems on ARC. This work lays a foundation for AGI research and paves the way for future extensions in few-shot generalization, program synthesis, and cognitive-inspired AI.',

          'Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a form of intelligence that matches or exceeds human intellectual capabilities across a broad range of cognitive tasks, remains the holy grail of AI research. Unlike narrow AI - designed to excel at a specific task - AGI requires adaptable, flexible reasoning and learning abilities. As François Chollet - founder of Keras deep-learning library - rightly observes, current benchmarks often measure skill in fixed domains, achievable by “buying” performance with massive data and compute, rather than truly assessing generalization or creativity [1]. Consequently, defining and evaluating genuine intelligence demands new frameworks - ones that reward rapid skill acquisition and strong reasoning over isolated expertise.',

          '''The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), created before LLMs even existed, is not merely a collection of puzzles - it is a meticulously designed dataset crafted to simulate the challenges of human-like abstraction and analogical reasoning. Introduced by François Chollet in 2019, the dataset comprises hundreds of small grid-based tasks, each consisting of a few input-output examples. These examples are meant to allow a human or an intelligent agent to infer the underlying transformation logic and apply it to new, unseen test inputs [1].

Each ARC task is structured as a collection of colored 2D grids, where each cell in the grid can hold a color value represented by an integer. A task typically includes three to five training pairs (input and expected output) and one or more test inputs for which the agent must generate the correct output [2]. These grids may vary in size, typically between 3×3 and 30×30, and the tasks are intentionally free from textual, numeric, or symbolic labels, emphasizing purely visual and structural understanding.

          '''What distinguishes ARC from traditional supervised learning datasets is that it does not support generalization through statistical learning. Instead, ARC tasks are designed to be solved from scratch, each requiring fresh reasoning with no benefit from training across tasks. This eliminates any advantage from pre-training on large corpora or memorizing task patterns. Each task in ARC is treated as an isolated reasoning problem, mimicking how a human would encounter and solve a logic puzzle for the first time [1], [7].

Chollet categorized the cognitive abilities required to solve ARC tasks into several types: object and shape recognition, counting and arithmetic, spatial reasoning, and symmetry detection. But critically, the dataset does not provide any predefined labels for these operations—agents must infer them through general reasoning. The dataset also leverages what Chollet refers to as "priors of human cognition", such as the ability to perceive groups of pixels as coherent objects or to expect consistency in geometric transformations [1].

One of ARC’s most innovative aspects is its Few shot Learning. In contrast to standard machine learning, which learns a function over many samples, ARC frames the problem as learning to learn from a few examples. The agent must identify a rule that maps inputs to outputs within a given task without having seen that rule before - making each problem a small episode of inductive program synthesis. This design reflects real-world intelligence, where agents often learn new tasks on the fly without millions of labeled examples [2].

Furthermore, the dataset is divided into three parts: a public training set of 400 tasks and a public evaluation set of 400 tasks (unlabeled).

          '''Despite the growing popularity and success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a variety of tasks, from text generation to coding, their ability to perform genuine reasoning remains a contentious question. At first glance, their strong performance on benchmarks like MATH, GSM8K [8], [9] or even logic puzzles might suggest a form of emergent intelligence. However, these models are largely trained on massive datasets, and much of their performance has been attributed to pattern recognition, memorization, and statistical interpolation [1], leading to the common critique that LLMs are "more memory than mystery".

The ARC designed to test core aspects of human-like abstraction, reasoning, and adaptation, poses a unique challenge to LLMs. ARC is intentionally resistant to memorization-based strategies, as each task is novel and demands few-shot or one-shot inductive reasoning. This makes it an ideal benchmark to probe whether LLMs possess any degree of general intelligence or if their abilities break down when faced with tasks outside their pre-training distributions.

Initial efforts to apply LLMs to ARC showed poor performance. Early systematic evaluations reveal that models such as GPT‑3.5 and GPT‑4 struggle significantly. GPT‑4 resolves only 13 out of 50 of the simplest ARC tasks when grids are encoded as text [10], [11]. Multimodal versions like GPT‑4V perform even worse in this context [11], reinforcing the notion that LLMs lack object-based and spatial reasoning without extensive prompting. These failures supported the hypothesis that LLMs depend heavily on memorized priors.

However, recent work on ARC using LLMs [12] challenges this assumption. By strategically decomposing ARC tasks, LLMs have demonstrated partial success in solving ARC tasks. These systems combine LLMs with symbolic tools, suggesting that - when heavily engineered - LLMs can exhibit behavior that mimics human-like abstraction.

This observation opens up a paradox: while LLMs can be guided to solve ARC tasks, this success often depends on massive data and repetitive training - resources far removed from the efficiency and minimal-example learning that ARC was designed to evaluate. In essence, LLMs can reason, but only if we subsidize their shortcomings with external factors. This raises a crucial research question:

Do LLMs genuinely possess abstract reasoning capabilities as measured by ARC, or is their success dependent on engineered prompts and brute-force augmentation?

Answering this question has significant implications for how we interpret the capabilities of LLMs. If success on ARC is achievable only through external manipulation and scale, then these systems remain far from AGI. On the other hand, if new architectures or training paradigms enable LLMs to solve ARC tasks efficiently, it may point toward a path for more generalizable intelligence. This research thus centers on evaluating the limits and potentials of LLMs on ARC - analyzing whether recent improvements indicate genuine reasoning, or merely a new form of memorization.

          '''In parallel with the growing research interest in ARC, foundational ideas by François Chollet have had a lasting influence on how intelligence is framed in machine learning. His 2019 article “On the Measure of Intelligence” proposed a novel perspective: that most modern AI systems exhibit narrow intelligence, excelling at specific tasks with vast supervision but failing to generalize or adapt to unfamiliar scenarios [1]. Chollet emphasized that true intelligence involves abstract reasoning and the capacity to learn new tasks with minimal prior knowledge - qualities that remain elusive for most deep learning systems [1].

This hypothesis led to the creation of the ARC benchmark, which evaluates AI systems based on their ability to solve novel tasks without prior training on similar examples. Chollet predicted that no AI system - even with access to large datasets—would solve ARC tasks robustly unless it demonstrated genuine generalization [1]. The implications of this work extended beyond ARC itself. It triggered renewed research on evaluating intelligence through generalization, leading to the emergence of alternative benchmarks such as PASCAL, CLEVR, and more recently, the BEHAVIOR and ALCHEMY datasets, which also aim to measure task transfer, compositionality, and abstraction in reasoning environments [18], [19].

Research since 2020 has explored ARC’s limitations and strengths. While many early attempts relied on deep learning or brute-force approaches that failed to generalize, newer methodologies - especially those using symbolic program synthesis have shown limited but meaningful gains. These efforts align with Chollet’s initial hypothesis: solving ARC requires more than memorization or scale - it demands adaptive, minimal-data reasoning, something still under development in the field [1].

ARC is a dataset designed to serve as a benchmark for general intelligence, comprising diverse tasks where the model is given input-output grid pairs and must predict the output for new inputs. The primary challenge with ARC is its few-shot nature, which makes it difficult for machine learning models to perform well due to the limited diversity in examples.

To overcome this, the author developed code that procedurally generates a broad range of unique examples for each ARC task by reversing the underlying distribution logic of the original examples. The generators ensure higher diversity, more complexity, and larger sample spaces than the original ARC examples, allowing for more extensive experimentation on tasks, including tasks that vary in grid size, object count, or complexity.

The generated examples are verified using task-specific functions to ensure their validity. The generators are designed to produce between 10,000 to hundreds of thousands of unique examples per task. Additionally, the process allows control over the difficulty of generated examples, providing opportunities to experiment with sample-efficient learning strategies and generalization techniques.

The study provides essential insights into improving machine learning models' performance on ARC by generating a wide variety of examples and considering task-specific difficulty levels. However, challenges remain, such as limitations in the generation process, verification efficiency, and ensuring the generated examples' applicability for human solvers''',

          '''In addition to our primary symbolic-neural approach, we also evaluated a convolutional segmentation model U-Net — trained on the ARC dataset using image-based representations. We applied data augmentations from RE-ARC and rendered the symbolic JSON grid tasks. While the model reported a seemingly high pixel-wise accuracy of 99%, the outputs were incorrect and misleading, representing classic false positives. The U-Net model failed to understand the task logic and instead overfit to visual patterns — especially the dominant blank-space background present in most ARC grids. As shown in the outputs below, the predicted results did not reflect the required grid transformations. Instead, the model often reproduced near-identical background visuals, which inflated pixel-accuracy scores without solving the actual problem. 

This failure occurred because converting structured JSON grids into flat images strips away their semantic and hierarchical meaning. U-Net could only learn superficial cues like edges or blankness, rather than abstract rules or relational patterns. Consequently, the model memorized trivial visual traits and produced outputs that appeared accurate numerically (pixel-wise), but semantically they were incorrect.

In summary, this experiment highlights the limitations of applying pixel-based CNN architectures to symbolic tasks like ARC. It reinforces the importance of preserving task structure through symbolic tokenization and the need for reasoning-based models over perceptual ones in few-shot abstraction tasks.

Through an example, we showed the method can discover correct programs for suitable tasks. We placed our results in the context of existing literature: prior DSL/GA systems solved only a few percent of tasks, while top LLM-based systems now achieve ~75%. This gap illustrates that ARC remains a formidable benchmark. Our work contributes to the symbolic end of the spectrum, offering an interpretable but limited solution method.',

          '''In this research, we set out to explore whether large language models (LLMs) possess true abstract reasoning abilities or simply mimic such behavior through memorized patterns and brute-force augmentation. By designing and implementing two complementary approaches—a symbolic DSL-based genetic algorithm and a fine-tuned LLM pipeline with structured augmentations—we were able to probe this question from both ends of the symbolic-to-neural spectrum.

What we found confirms a central insight:''',

          '''. While our LLM pipeline, equipped with careful data representation, augmentation, and sampling, achieved promising results on ARC-AGI tasks, the reasoning it demonstrated was largely emergent from engineered representations, not innate generalization. The success of these models hinged not on spontaneous intelligence, but on how cleverly we fed the problem to them.

ARC, by design, resists memorization-based approaches. Yet we observed that LLMs could still solve many tasks—not because they "understood" in the human sense, but because our preprocessing enabled them to exploit symbolic patterns. Even subtle changes in formatting or tokenization significantly altered outcomes, which is a clear indicator that the model’s success was dependent on surface-level pattern recognition, not deep abstraction.

Our findings reinforce Chollet’s assertion that true intelligence lies in the ability to generalize from minimal examples, a quality that current LLMs lack. They excel at interpolation within known distributions but falter in extrapolating new concepts. In the context of ARC, this means that their performance is tightly bound to the diversity of augmentations and the token-level tricks we applied—not to a genuine understanding of the underlying task.

Despite these limitations, we believe our work advances the frontier by showing how symbolic and neural components can complement each other. While LLMs alone are not yet AGI, when scaffolded with task-specific augmentations, token-level encoding, and structured search, they begin to exhibit behaviors that edge closer to generalization. The mystery, then, is not within the models themselves, but in the human ingenuity used to push their boundaries.
